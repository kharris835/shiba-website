      <p>
        The <strong>Shiba Inu</strong> is a breed of hunting dog from Japan. A
        small-to-medium breed, it is the smallest of the six original and
        distinct spitz breeds of dog native to Japan. A small, alert, and agile
        dog that copes very well with mountainous terrain and hiking trails, the
        Shiba Inu was originally bred for hunting.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        It looks similar to and is often mistaken for other Japanese dog breeds
        such as the <em>Akita Inu</em> or <em>Hokkaido</em>, but the Shiba Inu
        is a different breed with a distinct blood line, temperament, and
        smaller size than other Japanese dog breeds.
